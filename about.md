Hi, my name is Felix. I was born and raised in Hong Kong. Having completed my masters in Applied Math at Stanford, I decided to come back to Hong Kong to pursue entrepreneurship in the financial software space, building products for stock investors.  

On the side, I love to think about intelligence, specifically, how human intelligence arises and whether human level general intelligence can be replicated on machines. This motivates me to study machine learning. I strongly believe that machine learning, a process which attempts to produce intelligence behavior on machines, is an indispensable step towards the understanding of our own intelligence.     

I hope my blog can light up some eager minds who share the same passion as I do. If you want to collaborate on projects or kaggle ([my profile](https://www.kaggle.com/renman)), feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:flyyufelix@gmail.com).
